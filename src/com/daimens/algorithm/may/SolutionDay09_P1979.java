 *         1979. Red and Black Description
 * 
 *         There is a rectangular room, covered with square tiles. Each tile is
 *         colored either red or black. A man is standing on a black tile. From
 *         a tile, he can move to one of four adjacent tiles. But he can't move
 *         on red tiles, he can move only on black tiles.
 * 
 *         Write a program to count the number of black tiles which he can reach
 *         by repeating the moves described above. Input
 * 
 *         The input consists of multiple data sets. A data set starts with a
 *         line containing two positive integers W and H; W and H are the
 *         numbers of tiles in the x- and y- directions, respectively. W and H
 *         are not more than 20.
 * 
 *         There are H more lines in the data set, each of which includes W
 *         characters. Each character represents the color of a tile as follows.
 * 
 *         '.' - a black tile '#' - a red tile '@' - a man on a black
 *         tile(appears exactly once in a data set) The end of the input is
 *         indicated by a line consisting of two zeros. Output
 * 
 *         For each data set, your program should output a line which contains
 *         the number of tiles he can reach from the initial tile (including
 *         itself). Sample Input
 * 
 *         6 9 ....#. .....# ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... #@...# .#..#. 11
 *         9 .#......... .#.#######. .#.#.....#. .#.#.###.#. .#.#..@#.#.
 *         .#.#####.#. .#.......#. .#########. ........... 11 6 ..#..#..#..
 *         ..#..#..#.. ..#..#..### ..#..#..#@. ..#..#..#.. ..#..#..#.. 7 7
 *         ..#.#.. ..#.#.. ###.### ...@... ###.### ..#.#.. ..#.#.. 0 0 Sample
 *         Output
 * 
 *         45 59 6 13
