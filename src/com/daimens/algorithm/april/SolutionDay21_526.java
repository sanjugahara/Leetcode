 * 526.Beautiful Arrangement
 * 
 *         Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful
 *         arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers
 *         successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1
 *         ≤ i ≤ N) in this array:
 * 
 *         The number at the ith position is divisible by i. i is divisible by
 *         the number at the ith position. Now given N, how many beautiful
 *         arrangements can you construct?
