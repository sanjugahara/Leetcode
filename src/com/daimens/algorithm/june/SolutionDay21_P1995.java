 *         1995.Raising Modulo Numbers
 * 
 *         Description
 * 
 *         People are different. Some secretly read magazines full of
 *         interesting girls' pictures, others create an A-bomb in their cellar,
 *         others like using Windows, and some like difficult mathematical
 *         games. Latest marketing research shows, that this market segment was
 *         so far underestimated and that there is lack of such games. This kind
 *         of game was thus included into the KOKODÃ¡KH. The rules follow:
 * 
 *         Each player chooses two numbers Ai and Bi and writes them on a slip
 *         of paper. Others cannot see the numbers. In a given moment all
 *         players show their numbers to the others. The goal is to determine
 *         the sum of all expressions AiBi from all players including oneself
 *         and determine the remainder after division by a given number M. The
 *         winner is the one who first determines the correct result. According
 *         to the players' experience it is possible to increase the difficulty
 *         by choosing higher numbers.
 * 
 *         You should write a program that calculates the result and is able to
 *         find out who won the game.
 * 
 *         Input
 * 
 *         The input consists of Z assignments. The number of them is given by
 *         the single positive integer Z appearing on the first line of input.
 *         Then the assignements follow. Each assignement begins with line
 *         containing an integer M (1 <= M <= 45000). The sum will be divided by
 *         this number. Next line contains number of players H (1 <= H <=
 *         45000). Next exactly H lines follow. On each line, there are exactly
 *         two numbers Ai and Bi separated by space. Both numbers cannot be
 *         equal zero at the same time. Output
 * 
 *         For each assingnement there is the only one line of output. On this
 *         line, there is a number, the result of expression (A1B1+A2B2+ ...
 *         +AHBH)mod M.
 * 
 *         Sample Input
 * 
 *         3 16 4 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 36123 1 2374859 3029382 17 1 3 18132 Sample
 *         Output
