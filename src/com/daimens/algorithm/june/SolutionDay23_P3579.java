 *         3579.Median
 * 
 *         Description
 * 
 *         Given N numbers, X1, X2, ... , XN, let us calculate the difference of
 *         every pair of numbers: ∣Xi - Xj∣ (1 ≤ i ＜ j ≤ N). We can get C(N,2)
 *         differences through this work, and now your task is to find the
 *         median of the differences as quickly as you can!
 * 
 *         Note in this problem, the median is defined as the (m/2)-th smallest
 *         number if m,the amount of the differences, is even. For example, you
 *         have to find the third smallest one in the case of m = 6.
 * 
 *         Input
 * 
 *         The input consists of several test cases. In each test case, N will
 *         be given in the first line. Then N numbers are given, representing
 *         X1, X2, ... , XN, ( Xi ≤ 1,000,000,000 3 ≤ N ≤ 1,00,000 )
 * 
 *         Output
 * 
 *         For each test case, output the median in a separate line.
