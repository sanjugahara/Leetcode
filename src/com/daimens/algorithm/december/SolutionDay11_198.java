 * 198. House Robber
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
 * the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them
 * is that adjacent houses have security system connected
 * and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses
 * were broken into on the same night.
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money 
 * of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob 
 * tonight without alerting the police.
