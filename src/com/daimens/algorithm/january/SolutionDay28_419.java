 * 419.Battleships in a Board
 * Given an 2D board,count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'x' s,
 * empty slots are represented with '.'s.You may assume the following rules.
 * 1. You receive a valid board,made of only battleships or empty slots.
 * 2. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words,they can only be made of the
 * shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1(N rows, 1 column),where N can be of any size.
 * 3. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent
 * battleships.
 * Example:
 * X .. X
 * . .. X
 * . .. X
 * In the above board there are 2 battleships.
 * Invalid Example:
 * ...X
 * XXXX
 * ...X
 * This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating 
 * between them.
 *
